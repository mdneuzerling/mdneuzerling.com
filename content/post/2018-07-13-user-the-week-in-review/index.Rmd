That's it for #useR2018. After 6 keynotes, 132 parallel sessions, many more 
lightning talks and posters, and an all-important conference dinner, we've 
reached the end of the week.

This was my first proper conference since 2015. I had almost forgotten how
it felt to be surrounded by hundreds of people who are just as passionate 
(if not more) about your tiny area of specialised knowledge than you are.

I took notes for the three tutorials I went to, but I wanted to take a moment
to review the week as a whole, including the talks that stood out to me.
You can find my tutorial notes below:

* [Tutorial one: Getting Started with R and Docker](/post/user-getting-started-with-r-and-docker/)
* [Tutorial two: Recipes for Data Processing](/post/user-recipes-for-data-processing/)
* [Tutorial three: Missing Values Imputation](/post/user-missing-values-imputation/)

All talks and tutorials were recorded, so keep an eye out for them on the 
[useR2018 site](https://user2018.r-project.org/). The #rstats community is 
active on Twitter, so check out the [#useR2018](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23useR2018)
hashtag as well.

## A quick personal note

I'd like to declare my own biggest success and biggest failure of the 
conference:

* **Biggest personal win**: I posted notes from each of the three tutorials I 
went to! This forced me to learn more about PCA, which is a big win.
* **Biggest personal not-win**: I didn't present anything. I told myself this 
was because I had nothing to present, but I'm not so sure that's true.

## Talk highlights

* [Steph de Silva](https://twitter.com/StephdeSilva) spoke of R as not just a 
language but a *community*. And in this community you go from seeing R as 
something you use to seeing R as something you share. The R subculture(s) have 
real power to contribute in a world where data affects decisions. 
* [Rob Hyndman](https://twitter.com/robjhyndman)'s new `fable` package looks
super easy to use. It's a tidyverse-compatible replacement for his extremely
popular `forecast` package. He calls it "fable" because "fables aren't true but 
they tell you something useful about reality, just like a forecast."
* [Thomas Lin Pedersen](https://twitter.com/thomasp85) is rewriting the 
``gganimate`` package and it looks *so cool*. He described visualisation as
existing on a spectrum between static, interactive, and animated. Traditional
media (eg. newspapers) use static visualisation and modern journalism websites 
use interactive visualisation, but animated visualisation is often found in
social media.

* [Katie Sasso](https://twitter.com/KatieSasso) introduced **standalone Shiny
applications** using Electron. I am so keen to try these out! Imagine being
able to distribute a Shiny app to someone without them needing to so much as 
install R.
* [Nicholas Tierney](https://twitter.com/nj_tierney)'s `maxcovr` package makes
it easier to solve the [maximal coverage location problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_coverage_problem) in R.
His choice of example was apt. Brisbane offers free public wifi in and around
the CBD, and the `maxcovr` package can be used to identify optimal placemennt 
of new routers to improver the coverage population and area.
* [Roger D. Peng](https://twitter.com/rdpeng) spoke about the teaching R.
I loved the quote from John Chambers on S (R's predecessor): "We wanted users 
to begin in an interactive environment, where they did not consciously think of 
themselves as programming... they should be able to slide gradually into 
programming." This is the R value proposition in a nutshell for me: you don't 
*have* to jump into the developer side of things, but if you want to start 
going down that path it's a gradual transition.

* [Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan) spoke about code smells and 
feels. Whenever I read something cool and useful about R I look at the author 
and there's a good chance it's Jenny. I like that the advice in her talk is
more "use this in moderation" rather than the prescriptive "Don't do this".
* [Danielle Navarro](https://twitter.com/djnavarro) shared her experience in 
teaching R to psychology students. This one resonated, especially with her
emphasis on student fear. Student fear stops learning before it can begin!
* [Martin Mächler](https://twitter.com/MMaechler) of the R Core team discussed
an often-neglected topic: numerical precision. It was a chance to get into the
guts of R. He also gave the following bizarre example:

```{r bad_precision}
unique((1:10)/10 - (0:9)/10)
```
