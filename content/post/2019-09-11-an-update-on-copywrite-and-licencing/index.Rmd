When I started this blog I wanted a way to share the quick little projects that distract me. I gave some thought to licencing, but I wanted to make sure that people could use my code if it had any value to them. This is just a little blog by a very unimportant guy---if someone got some use out of my code, I would be flattered!

However, in the last few days I've seen some unwelcome behaviour. People have been copying my work into their own LinkedIn posts, changing my words but not adding value. It makes me uncomfortable to see my work used this way.

This is a restrictive licence, and I don't want to restrict anyone who is genuinely contributing to the R community, instead of just trying to boost their LinkedIn profile. If this restriction isn't working for you, [contact me](/about), and I'll help as best I can. I'll be genuinely flattered---and surprised---that something I've made can be helpful to you.
