My knowledge of wine covers three facts:

1. I like red wine.
1. I do not like white wine.
1. I love wine *data*.

I came across a great collection of around 130,000 wine reviews, each a 
paragraph long, on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews).
This is juicy stuff, and I can't wait to dig into it with some text analysis,
or maybe build some sort of markov chain or neural network that generates new 
wine reviews.

But I wanted to start with something simple---a little bit of feature
engineering. There's around 700 different *varieties* (eg. merlot, riesling)
in here, and I thought it would be easy to add on whether or not they were
red, white or rosé. 

It was not.

I won't show you all the failed attempts; I'll just focus on what worked in the 
end. This is the process:

1. Scrape wine colour data from Wikipedia
1. Join the colours with the wine varieties
1. Fix errors and duplicates
1. Improve the wine colour data, and repeat
1. When all else fails, manually classify what remains.

Classifying wine into three simple categories is a tough ask, and I can hear the
connoisseurs tutting at me. Some grapes can be red and white, and I'm told that
there's such a thing as "orange" wine (and no, it's not made from 
oranges---I did ask). Dessert wines and sparkling wines can probably be 
classified as red or white, but really they're off doing their own thing. I 
acknowledge how aggressive this classification is, but I'm going to charge
ahead anyway.

## Quick look at the data

```{r setup, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, cache = TRUE)

set.seed(42275) # Chosen by fair dice roll. Guaranteed to be random.
 
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2) 
library(rvest)

red_wine_colour <- "#59121C"
white_wine_colour <- "#EADB9F"
rose_wine_colour <- "#F5C0A2"

wine <- "wine_reviews.csv" %>% 
    read_csv %>% 
    mutate(variety = variety %>% tolower)

wine %>% str
```


I think this data will keep me entertained for a while. There's a lot to dig 
into here, and those reviews are going to be interesting when I can pull them
apart. For example, `r nrow(filter(wine, grepl("tennis ball", description)))`
wines are described as tasting of tennis balls, and these wines are rated 
about average. It makes me think that I'm not spending enough time in life
appreciating the taste of tennis balls. Dogs understand this.

Speaking of points, it appears as though wines are ranked on a scale from 80
to 100. Although, looking at the plot below, you'd be forgiven for thinking that
the scale is from 80 to 97. Only 0.01% of wines make it to a rating of 100.

```{r points}
wine %>% ggplot(aes(x = points)) + 
    geom_histogram(
        bins = nrow(wine %>% distinct(points)),
        colour = "white",
        fill = red_wine_colour
    )
```

The review below is for an 80-point wine, and it's certainly one of my 
favourite descriptions:

```{r grandma_wine, results='asis'}
wine %>% 
    filter(X1 == 11086) %>% 
    select(description) %>% 
    paste0('> ', .) %>% # print as quote
    cat
```

One wine, indexed 86909, has a missing variety. Fortunately, we can recover the
information from the review:

```{r missing_variety_review, results='asis'}
wine %>% 
    filter(X1 == 86909) %>% 
    select(description) %>% 
    paste0('> ', .) %>% # print as quote
    cat
```

```{r fix_missing_variety}
wine <- wine %>% mutate(
  variety = ifelse(X1 == 86909, "petite syrah", variety)
)
```

## Scraping Wikipedia

In order to classify the wines as red, white or rosé, we're going to scrape
wine data from the [List of grape varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_grape_varieties)
Wikipedia page, using the `rvest` package. The first three tables of this page
give red, white and rosé wines, in that order.

We're going to use an older version of the article, dated 2018-06-29, for 
consistency. Wikipedia displays a notice that the user is reading an older 
version of the article. This counts as a table, and so the code below refers to
tables 2, 3 and 4. If using the live version, replace these figures with 1, 2
and 3.

```{r grape_colours_wiki_scrape, message = FALSE}
# Use an old revision of the article for consistency
wiki_tables <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_grape_varieties&oldid=847983339" %>% 
    read_html %>% 
    html_nodes("table")
red_wines <- wiki_tables[[1]] %>% html_table %>% cbind(colour = "red")
white_wines <- wiki_tables[[2]] %>% html_table %>% cbind(colour = "white")
rose_wines <- wiki_tables[[3]] %>% html_table %>% cbind(colour = "rosé")
all_wines <- rbind(red_wines, white_wines, rose_wines)
all_wines %>% 
    select(`Common Name(s)`, `All Synonyms`, colour) %>% 
    head(1)
```    

We're interested in three columns here: `Common Name(s)`, `All Synonyms` and
the `colour` column we defined from the table scraping. We will take the 
opportunity to rename the columns to match the tidyverse style.

Apart from synonyms, some wines can also have multiple common names, eg. 
"shiraz / syrah". The synonyms seem to be very broad, and can include some
unexpected results: pinot grigio (also known as pinot gris) is used to produce
white wine, yet it appears as a synonym to canari noir, which is used to make
red wine.

We're going to preference the common names over the synonyms, so that in any
conflict we use the colour as given by the common name. To do this, we're going
to `unnest` the common names and clean the results so that all entries are in 
lower-case, the results are distinct, and certain stray bits of punctuation are 
removed. We're then going to do the same with the synonyms, but when we combine
the results we will ignore all entries that are already provided by the common
names.

The end result will be a single table with two columns: `variety`, and `colour`. 
The table may very well still contain duplicates, but certainly less than we 
would have had if we had treated common names and synonyms as equals.

```{r grape_colours_cleaning, message = FALSE}
all_wines_cleaned <- all_wines %>% 
    rename(
        common_names = `Common Name(s)`,
        synonyms = `All Synonyms`
    ) %>% 
    mutate_all(tolower) %>% 
    select(common_names, synonyms, colour)

common_names <- all_wines_cleaned %>%
    unnest(common_names = strsplit(common_names, " / ")) %>% # split common names into separate rows
    rename(variety = common_names) %>% 
    mutate(
        variety = gsub("\\.", "", variety), # remove periods 
        variety = gsub("\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)", "", variety), # remove brackets and anything within
        variety = gsub("\\s*\\[[^\\)]+\\]", "", variety) # same for square brackets
    ) %>% 
    select(variety, colour)

synonyms <- all_wines_cleaned %>% 
    unnest(synonyms = strsplit(synonyms, ", ")) %>% # split the synonyms into multiple rows
    rename(variety = synonyms) %>% 
    mutate(
        variety = gsub("\\.", "", variety), # remove periods 
        variety = gsub("\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)", "", variety), # remove brackets and anything within
        variety = gsub("\\s*\\[[^\\)]+\\]", "", variety) # same for square brackets
    ) %>% 
    select(variety, colour) %>% 
    anti_join(common_names, by = "variety") # remove synonyms if we have a common name

variety_colours <- rbind(common_names, synonyms) %>% 
    distinct %>% 
    arrange(variety)

variety_colours %>% head
```    

The end result is `r nrow(variety_colours)` rows, with plenty of repeated 
entries to accommodate for multiple names or variations in spelling.

## Joining the colour data

Now we join the colours with the wine data. If there are any missing values, we 
can attempt to fill them in based on obvious clues in the variety (eg. a "Red 
blend" can safely be assumed to be a red wine). We're going to repeat this
join as we iteratively improve the `variety_colours` data, so we'll define it 
as a function.

```{r join_with_variety_colours}
join_with_variety_colours <- function(wine, variety_colours) {
    wine %>% 
        left_join(
            variety_colours %>% select(variety, colour),
            by = "variety"
        ) %>% 
        mutate(
            colour = case_when(
                !is.na(colour) ~ colour,
                grepl("sparkling", variety, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "white",
                grepl("champagne", variety, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "white",
                grepl("red", variety, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "red",
                grepl("white", variety, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "white",
                grepl("rosé", variety, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "rosé",
                grepl("rose", variety, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "rosé"
            )
        )
}

wine_colours <- wine %>% join_with_variety_colours(variety_colours)

plot_wine_colours <- function(wine_colours) {
    wine_colours %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = colour, fill = colour)) + 
    geom_bar() + 
    scale_fill_manual(values = c(
        "red" = red_wine_colour, 
        "white" = white_wine_colour, 
        "rosé" = rose_wine_colour),
        na.value = "grey"
    ) + 
    ggtitle("Wine colours") +
    theme(legend.position="none")
}

plot_wine_colours(wine_colours)
```

All but `r nrow(filter(wine_colours, is.na(colour)))` wines have been 
classified. We still have some colours missing, but first we consider the wines 
that have been classified as multiple colours:

```{r wrong_colours}
wine_colours %>% 
    distinct(variety, colour) %>% 
    count(variety) %>% 
    filter(n > 1)
```

We use web searches to manually classify the varieties based on the colour of 
the wine that is most often produced from them.

```{r wrong_colours_fix}
variety_colours <- variety_colours %>% 
    filter(!(variety == "alicante" & colour != "red")) %>%     
    filter(!(variety == "grignolino" & colour != "red")) %>% 
    filter(!(variety == "malvasia fina" & colour != "white")) %>% # rarely red
    filter(!(variety == "sauvignon" & colour != "white"))
```

The below suggests that blends are not being classified:

```{r missing_colours}
wine_colours %>% 
    filter(is.na(colour)) %>% 
    count(variety, sort = TRUE) %>% 
    head(10)
```

We operate under the assumption that if multiple wines are listed, the first
wine determines the colour. For example, cabernet is red and sauvignon is white,
but cabernet sauvignon is red. We try to classify the unclassified wines again
but using only the first word in their varieties. We split the variety by either
spaces or dashes.

```{r blend_classification}
blend_colours <- 
    wine_colours %>% 
    filter(is.na(colour)) %>% 
    select(variety) %>% 
    rowwise %>% 
    mutate(first_variety = unlist(strsplit(variety, "\\-|\\ | "))[1]) %>% 
    merge(variety_colours, by.x = "first_variety", by.y = "variety") %>% 
    select(variety, colour) %>% 
    distinct
```

Now we can rebuild the wine colours using these new blend results:

```{r join_with_blend_colours}
wine_colours <- wine %>% join_with_variety_colours(
    rbind(variety_colours, blend_colours)
) 

plot_wine_colours(wine_colours)
```

All but `r nrow(filter(wine_colours, is.na(colour)))` wines have been 
classified. This is an improvement, but we still have to classify the rest.

## Manual classifications

We manually classify the remaining 
`r wine_colours %>% filter(is.na(colour)) %>% distinct(variety) %>% nrow`
varieties using web searches or the `description`s (reviews) associated with
the wines.

```{r manual_colours}
manual_colours <- "manually_classified.csv" %>% read_csv

wine_colours <- wine %>% join_with_variety_colours(
    rbind(variety_colours, blend_colours, manual_colours)
) 

plot_wine_colours(wine_colours)
```

And we're there! As I said earlier, this is a somewhat aggressive 
classification. But we've got the most popular wines---the pinot noirs and the
chardonnays---classified, and we can hope that any errors are only "kind of 
wrong" rather than "totally wrong", and limited to the varieties that only 
appear once or twice.

## Data sources

To avoid any potential licencing issues, I prefer not to post Kaggle data 
directly here. I encourage you to download the csv 
[directly from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/). This will
require a (free) Kaggle account. I've renamed the file here to `wine_reviews.csv`,
but otherwise the data is unchanged before it is read. Other data used here:

* My manual classification of variety colours: [manually_classified.csv](/data/manually_classified.csv)
* The final outcome, giving just varieties and colours: [variety_colours.csv](/data/variety_colours.csv)
