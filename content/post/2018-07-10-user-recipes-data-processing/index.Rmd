These are my notes for the tutorial given by 
[Max Kuhn](https://twitter.com/topepos) on the afternoon of the first day of the
UseR 2018 conference. 

Full confession here: I was having trouble deciding between this tutorial 
and another one, and eventually decided on the other one. But then I 
accidentally came to the wrong room and I took it as a sign that it was time 
to learn more about preprocessing.

Also, the `recipes` package is *adorable*.

```{r echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '1016541132057075712')
```

I'm going to follow along with 
[Max's slides](https://github.com/topepo/user2018), making some comments along 
the way.

Required packages:

```{r install_packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("AmesHousing", "broom", "kknn", "recipes", "rsample",
                   "tidyverse", "yardstick", "caret"))
```

```{r load_packages, include = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(rsample)
library(recipes)
library(caret)
```

The data set we'll use is the AMES IA housing data. This includes sale 
price (our target) along with 81 predictors, such as location, house 
components (eg. swimming pool), number of bedrooms, and so on. The raw data can
be found at [https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock/AmesHousing.txt](https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock/AmesHousing.txt) 
but we will be using the processed version found in the `AmesHousing` package.

## Reasons for modifying the data

Sometimes you need to *do stuff* to your data before you can use it. 
Moreover, you're often dealing with data that's split into train/test sets. In 
this case you need to work out what to do with your data based solely on the 
training set and then apply that---without changing your method---to the test 
set. If you're dealing with $K$-fold cross-validation, then you've got $K$ 
training sets and $K$ test sets, and so you need to repeat this $K$ times.

A good example is missing value imputation, where you have some missing data in
your train/test sets and you need to fill them in via some imputation method.
I'm no expert on the topic (but I hope to be after the missing value imputation
tutorial tomorrow!) but I've seen this done wrong before in StackExchange 
answers and in Kaggle solutions: the imputation is done *before* the data is
split into train/test. This is called *data leakage*, and models assessed using
the test set will appear more accurate than they are, because they've already
had a sneak preview of the data.

So the mindset is clear: don't touch the test set until the last possible 
moment. The `recipes` package follows this mindset. First you create a 
`recipe`, which is a blueprint for how you will process your data. At this 
point, no data has been modified. Then you `prep` the recipe using your
training set, which is where the actual processing is defined and all the 
parameters worked out. Finally, you can `bake` the training set, test set, or 
any other data set with similar columns, and in this step the actual 
modification takes place.

Missing value **imputation** isn't the only reason to process data, though.
Processing can involve:

* **Centering** and **scaling** the predictors. Some models (K-NN, SBMs, PLS, 
neural networks) require that the predictor variables have the same units. 
* Applying **filters** or **PCA signal extraction** to deal with correlation 
between predictors.
* **Encoding data**, such as turning factors into Boolean dummy variables, or
turning dates into days of the week.
* Developing new features (ie. **feature engineering**).

## The `ames` data

We load the data with the `make_ames` function from the `AmesHousing` package.

```{r ames_load, cache = FALSE}
ames <- AmesHousing::make_ames()
ames %>% str
```

Now we will split the data into test and train. We'll reserve 25% of of the 
data for testing.

```{r ames_split, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
library(rsample)
set.seed(4595)
data_split <- initial_split(ames, strata = "Sale_Price", p = 0.75)
ames_train <- training(data_split)
ames_test <- testing(data_split)
```

## A simple log-transform

The first of Max's examples is a really simple log transform of `Sale_Price`.
Suppose we use the formula `log10(Sale_Price) ~ Longitude + Latitude`. 
The steps are:

1. Assign `Sale_Price` to the outcome.
1. Assign `Longitude` and `Latittude` as predictors.
1. Log transform the outcome.

The way to define this in `recipes` is as follows:

```{r recipes_max_example, eval = FALSE}
mod_rec <- recipe(Sale_Price ~ Longitude + Latitude, data = ames_train) %>% 
    step_log(Sale_Price, base = 10)
```

## Infrequently occurring levels

We usually encode factors as Boolean dummy variables, with R often taking care 
of this in the background. If there are `C` levels of the factor, only `C - 1` 
dummy variables are required. But what if you have very few values for a 
particular level? For example, the `Neighborhood` predictor in our `ames` data:

```{r ames_locations, cache = FALSE}
ames %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Neighborhood)) +
    geom_bar(fill = "#6d1e3b", colour = "white") + # I don't like the default grey
    coord_flip()
```

In fact, there's only one data point with a `Neighborhood` of Landmark. This is
called a "zero-variance predictor". There are two main approaches here:

1. remove any data points with infrequently occurring values, or
2. group all of the infrequently occurring values into an "Other" level.

This is a job for the `recipes` package, and Max takes us through the example.

We can take care of the infrequently occurring levels here using the 
`step_other` function. In this case, we "other" any level that occurs fewer 
than 5% of the time. We can then create dummy variables for all factor 
variables with `step_dummy`:

```{r recipes_max_example_2, cache = FALSE}
mod_rec <- recipe(Sale_Price ~ Longitude + Latitude + Neighborhood, 
                  data = ames_train) %>% 
    step_log(Sale_Price, base = 10) %>% # The log-transform from earlier
    step_other(Neighborhood, threshold = 0.05) %>%
    step_dummy(all_nominal())
```

## The `recipes` process

Recipes work in a three-step process: `recipe` --> `prepare` --> `bake`/`juice`.
We can think of this as: define --> estimate --> apply. `juice` only applies to
the original data set defined in the recipe, the idea at the core of `bake` is
that it can be applied to an *arbitrary* data set.

First we `prep` the data using the recipe in Max's example:

```{r recipes_max_prep, cache = FALSE}
mod_rec_trained <- mod_rec %>% 
    prep(training = ames_train, retain = TRUE)
mod_rec_trained
```

We can now `bake` the recipe, applying it to the test set we defined earlier:

```{r recipes_max_bake, cache = FALSE}
ames_test_dummies <- mod_rec_trained %>% bake(new_data = ames_test)
names(ames_test_dummies)
```

## Other uses

I have to admit that the rest got away from me a little bit, because I'm not 
overly familiar with all of the transformations/methods that were used (what 
is a Yeo-Johnson Power Transformation?!).

However, there's a tonne of cool stuff in the slides that I'll be coming back 
to later, I'm sure. Max used `recipes` and `rsample` to:

* deal with interactions between predictors,
* apply processing to all of the folds of a 10-fold cross-validation,
* train 10 linear models on that same 10-fold cross-validation,
* assess and plot the performance of those linear models, and
* train and asses 10 nearest-neighbour models on the 10-fold cross-validation.

I know I'll be using this `recipes` package *a lot*.
