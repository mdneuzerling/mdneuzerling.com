These are my notes for the super helpful tutorial given by 
[Elizabeth Stark](https://twitter.com/tech_is_dead) on the first day of the
UseR 2018 conference. This was an introduction to Docker for R users who have 
no prior experience with Docker (which was me!).

* [Elizabeth's slides](https://github.com/SymbolixAU/useR_docker_tutorial)
* [Elizabeth's exercises and examples](https://github.com/SymbolixAU/R_docker_hello)

This tutorial took me through setting up an RStudio Server container. I'm on a 
Linux machine, but I'm particularly interested by the idea that you could run
these traditionally Linux-only servers on a Windows machine through Docker.

## Docker glossary

* A container is like a virtual machine, but it just has the user-space stuff. 
It consists of:
    * A Docker image. This is an ["ordered collection of root filesystem changes 
    and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container 
    runtime."](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=image)
    * An execution environment
    * A standard set of instructions
* A Dockerfile is like source code for an image.
* Docker is software that builds images and runs containers. Its logo is an 
adorable whale/cargo ship.

I will admit, the difference between an image and a container confuses me. From 
what I can tell, you `build` an **image**, and then when you `run` the image it 
turns into a **container**. Images are layered on top of one another. The `run` 
command takes an image, adds a file system, and executes some instructions.

It sounds like a virtual machine to me, though. But a virtual machine has a 
guest operating system, whereas a container doesn't. Docker provides the guest
operating system, and the container provides the application and the libraries.
The advantage here is that a virtual machine has to boot, which can take a long
time, whereas Docker images can be run in seconds.

Containers are ephemeral. Any changes to a running container, such as new user
data, will disappear as soon as Docker stops running the container.

## Running docker images

Docker images require `sudo` by default. You can do without `sudo` by adding 
your use to the docker group, but this carries some security implications. In
particular, users in the group will have unmoderated access to the root
filesystem. I've added myself to the group for the duration of this tutorial. [This article](https://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2015/08/why-we-dont-let-non-root-users-run-docker-in-centos-fedora-or-rhel/) gives a good rundown of why you might *not* want to allow
non-root access to Docker.

The first Docker image you ever `run` is likely to be `hello-world`. If you've
never run it before, Docker will download it from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).

```{bash docker_hello_world}
docker run hello-world
```

Quick aside: yes, this is me running a Docker image in an R Markdown file. 
Remember that R Markdown can handle languages other than R, including bash!
This code chunk is `{bash docker_hello_world}`, which tells `knitr` to run this
chunk (called `docker_hello_world`) with bash. I imagine this only works 
because the `hello-world` container outputs to `stdout`.

## Rocker

[Rocker](https://hub.docker.com/u/rocker/) exists on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)
and contains a whole bunch of images relevant to R users. 

Dockerfiles (the source code for images) start `FROM` a base image. We can
`COPY` files, `RUN` commands, or set `ENV` variables. Here's the head of the
RStudio Dockerfile:

```{bash rstudio_dockerfile_head, eval = FALSE}
FROM rocker/r-ver:latest

ARG RSTUDIO_VERSION
ENV PATH=/usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin:$PATH

## Download and install RStudio server & dependencies
## Attempts to get detect latest version, otherwise falls back to version given in $VER
## Symlink pandoc, pandoc-citeproc so they are available system-wide
RUN apt-get update \
  && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    file \
    git \
    libapparmor1 \
    libcurl4-openssl-dev \
    libedit2 \
    libssl-dev \
    lsb-release \
    psmisc \
	procps \
    python-setuptools \
    sudo \
    wget \
  && wget -O libssl1.0.0.deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.0.0_1.0.1t-1+deb8u8_amd64.deb \
  && dpkg -i libssl1.0.0.deb \
  && rm libssl1.0.0.deb \
  && RSTUDIO_LATEST=$(wget --no-check-certificate -qO- https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-server/current.ver) \
  && [ -z "$RSTUDIO_VERSION" ] && RSTUDIO_VERSION=$RSTUDIO_LATEST || true \
  && wget -q http://download2.rstudio.org/rstudio-server-${RSTUDIO_VERSION}-amd64.deb \
```

## R hello world

We're going to build and run the example R hello world image linked at the top
of this page. This is following Elizabeth Stark's [blog post](https://www.symbolix.com.au/blog-main/r-docker-hello). First, clone the
repository at the top of this page and `cd` into the newly created directory.

Here's the Dockerfile, which tells us what is going on here. Note the base image,
RStudio, and a `requirements.R` file. The required R packages for the image are
stored in this file. When the image is built, the libraries are installed.

```{bash r_hello_world_docker_file, eval = FALSE}
# Base image https://hub.docker.com/u/rocker/
FROM rocker/rstudio

## Install extra R packages using requirements.R
## Specify requirements as R install commands e.g.
## 
## install.packages("<myfavouritepacakge>") or
## devtools::install("SymbolixAU/googleway")

## Copy requirements.R to container directory /tmp
COPY ./DockerConfig/requirements.R /tmp/requirements.R 
## install required libs on container
RUN Rscript /tmp/requirements.R

# create an R user
ENV USER rstudio

## Copy your working files over
## The $USER defaults to `rstudio` but you can change this at runtime
COPY ./Analysis /home/$USER/Analysis
COPY ./Data /home/$USER/Data
```

Run the following command to `build` the image:

```{bash r_hello_world_build, eval = FALSE}
docker build --rm --force-rm -t rstudio/hello-world .
```

The `--rm --force-rm` command tells Docker to delete the container once it's 
run. This keeps the server clean. The `-t rstudio/hello-world` option names the
resulting image. We can see our installed Docker images, including the 
`hello-world` image we just built, by running the following command:

```{bash list_docker_containers}
docker image list
```

Now we can `run` the image. We `--name` the container `hello-world`. You may be
aware that RStudio server runs on port 8787 by default, but here we `run` the
container on port 28787.

```{bash r_hello_world_run, eval = FALSE}
docker run -d --rm -p 28787:8787 --name hello-world rstudio/hello-world
```

The command runs and then we are returned to the terminal. At first I thought
nothing had happened and I had managed to break something this early on. But 
when I opened my browser and went to http://127.0.0.1:28787 I saw a login page!

![](img/rstudio_login.webp)

The default username and password are both `rstudio`. Logging in, I see a 
familiar interface.

![](img/rstudio_in_container.webp)

We can stop the container with the `stop` command. This will interrupt the 
RStudio Server instance and delete any inputted data.

```{bash r_hello_world_stop, eval = FALSE}
docker stop hello-world
```

### Playing with the `hello-world` image

* The `docker ps` command lists running images.
* You can run the same container more than once, but they have to have different
names and run on different ports.
* If you add a package to the requirements.R and rebuild, it will install the
package and all dependencies.
* Set environment variables when running an image by using the `-e` option, eg.
`-e USERID=$UID -e PASSWORD=SoSecret!`
* Save data to a persistent location by mounting a volume using the `-v` option, eg.
`-v $DATA_DIR:/home/rstudio/Data`

### A note on security

For security reasons, you often can't access environment variables (such as 
those set by `ENV` or `-e`) from RStudio Server or Shiny. Instead, you could 
include an `.Renviron` file in the build context. Be sure to configure your
`.gitignore` file so that you don't accidentally upload secrets to GitHub!

Elizabeth went through an example with the `googleway` package, which uses 
Google Maps API keys. In the Dockerbuild file, she includes a `COPY` command
to copy the API key to `/home/$USER`.

### Managing Docker without leaving R

Like many R users, I don't like having to do anything outside of R. The 
`docker` R package uses Python (through `reticulate`) to manage Docker. See
the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/docker/vignettes/Getting_Started_with_Docker.html).

## Docker on AWS

Elizabeth kindly offered to taked us through launching an EC2 instance on AWS
and running Docker on it. 

We're going to be a little bit lazy with some of the
settings here under the assumption that we'll delete everything when we're done.
If you don't do this, you may be charged more than you intended!

I already have an AWS account, although I haven't used it in a while. You can 
see my 0 EC2 instances below:

![](img/EC2_dashboard.webp)

I'm going to launch a new instance. I will first be prompted to choose the type 
of image. I'm going to go with the generic Ubuntu image at the bottom of the 
picture below:

![](img/choose_image.webp)

I'll next be asked to choose the specifications of my machine. I'm going to 
launch an instance with 4GB of RAM. As of now, this will charge me USD 0.0584 
per hour to run the instance in Sydney. I don't see myself needing it for more 
than an hour.

![](img/select_specs.webp)

Click on "Next: Configure Instance Details". On the next page we're going to 
change the shutdown behaviour from "Stop" to "Terminate". This will 
permanently remove the instance when it is stopped, which is okay for now
because we only want a temporary instance.

![](img/shutdown_terminate.webp)

On the next screen, we'll give ourselves some storage. I'm choosing 20GB here, 
which should be enough for this machine's temporary purpose.

![](img/configure_storage.webp)

When you go to launch the instance, you'll be asked about key pairs. Create a 
new key and be sure to download the pem file. I'm going to call the keypair 
"temp_docker".

![](img/key_pair.webp)

Proceed to see that your instance is launched! You can click through here to 
see your EC2 instance up and running. Take note of the IPv4 public IP here: we 
will need this to SSH into the machine, and to access our RStudio server.

![](img/instance_monitoring.webp)

You can click on the instance and then on the "Connect" button to view detailed 
instructions on how to SSH into your newly created instance. Once you've SSH'd
into the machine, run the following bash command to install the Community 
Edition of Docker. If the command fails, try to install `docker-ce` instead.

```{bash install_docker, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y docker-io
```

You can test that the installation works by running 
`sudo docker run hello-world`, as we did locally earlier. Docker will first 
install the `hello-world` image, since it hasn't been `run` before.

```{bash pull_rstudio_EC2, eval = FALSE}
sudo docker pull rocker/rstudio
```

It's a big install (around a gigabyte) so you may have to wait a few minutes. 
Now we can run our server:

```{bash run_rstudio_EC2, eval = FALSE}
sudo docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 --name rstudio rocker/rstudio
```

Remember that IPv4 address you noted earlier? Put that in the address bar of 
your browser, followed by the default RStudio port 8787. For my example, I went 
to 13.211.29.244:8787, but your instance will be running on a different IP 
address.

And it won't work! 

You'll notice that the page will try to load for a while but won't get anywhere. 
This smells like a firewall issue to me. Go back to your EC2 dashboard and 
scroll to the right to see the securty group in use by your EC2 instance. Click 
on the security group, which for me was "launch-wizard-1". Click on "Actions" 
and "Edit inbound rules". 

You'll see that SSH is allowed through port 22 to an ip address range 0.0.0.0/0. 
This actually refers to every IP address. We're going to add a new "Custom TCP" 
rule and allow all access to port 8787 from 0.0.0.0/0. 
 
![](img/edit_security_group.webp)

Usually we would be very concerned about security here; in general we don't
want everyone in the world to be able to access our R Studio server! But this 
short-lived machine isn't used for anything important, so we can skip along here.

Save your changes and return to your instances ip address, which for me was 
13.211.29.244:8787. You should see the same RStudio log-in screen that appeared 
when we ran the R `hello-world` image earlier. At this point, feel free to log 
in using the default username and password, `rstudio`.

As a final step, be sure to go to your AWS dashboard to stop (and therefore 
terminate) your EC2 instance. The storage volume we created earlier *should* be
deleted alongside the EC2 instance, but you may wish to double-check.

## And that's it!

That's the end of the workshop. Many thanks to Elizabeth for her time, and for 
a great start to useR 2018!
